Progress Report:
Our team created our own project shell in c++.
The CSP solver consists of backtrackingSolver.cpp/h which contains the logic for generating a constraint graph and executing a search.
The solver makes use of sudokuBoardReader.cpp/h to read the input file and create a SudokuBoard object.
The SudokuBoard object keeps track of p, q, N and the state of the board it also handles assignment validation.

Our team deserves extra credit for implementing our own shell in c++ without making a direct copy of the given shell.

Our team also deserves extra credit for creating a problem generator. See BoardGenerator.cpp/h for implementation and run genBuild to build the gen executable.
It has NOT been integrated into our main executable because we were unclear on if it was a separate program or a part of the solver we were to write.
